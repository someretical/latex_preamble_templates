# LaTeX Preamble Templates

## Windows Notes

The GhostScript CLI is installed as `gsw64c.exe`. To ensure compatibility with the settings, rename it to `gs.exe`

Furthermore, the `final` folder must be manually created.

## Linux Notes

To make sure the LaTeX workshop and LaTeX utility extensions can find all the binaries in the path, launch `code` from the command line. For some reason, doing it any other way means code does not get access to the updated PATH variable.
